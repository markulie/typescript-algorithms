# JavaScript/TypeScript Algorithms

## Overview

Welcome to the **JavaScript and TypeScript Algorithms** repository! This collection is based on my original C# algorithms, now adapted and optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript. The purpose of this project is to provide beginner JS/TS programmers with a variety of algorithms to study, understand, and implement.

## Purpose

The main objective of this repository is to offer a hands-on learning resource for beginners. By exploring these algorithms, you will gain a deeper understanding of fundamental programming concepts and enhance your problem-solving skills in JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Easy-to-follow Code**: Each algorithm is written in a clear and concise manner, making it accessible for beginners.
- **Comprehensive Comments**: Detailed comments are provided to explain the logic and flow of each algorithm.
- **C# Comparisons**: Where applicable, references to the original C# versions are included to show the transition between languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with these algorithms:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/markulie/javascript-typescript-algorithms.git
   cd js-ts-algorithms
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** (if any):
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
3. **Install TypeScript and ts-node globally**:
   ```sh
   npm i -g typescript ts-node
   ```

4. **Run the Algorithms**:
   ```sh
   ts-node src/{fileName}.ts
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new algorithms to add, please feel free to submit a pull request. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows the repository's coding standards.
